<h1>Chapter 1: Murderers and Friends</h1>
<p><em>“You know I wouldn’t have killed her if it was anybody else”</em> said Shashadri to the other inmate as they leaned on the parapet in front of their cells. The other inmate, a boy of 18, had been caught for armed assault, when he and a gang of friends tried to wrestle some loot from an elderly couple from their home in Jayanagar Bangalore.</p>
<p>Shashadri on the other hand was a murderer. He had murdered his wife for having an affair with his Manager in a well known IT firm. He had no regrets and had only one ambition left in his life, to kill his ex-manager as well.</p>
<p><em>“I am happy about one thing though, I could uncover that bastard. I hear his family life collapsed”</em> he continued with a smile.</p>
<p>The boy didn’t know too much english, but he understood enough swear words to understand that Shashadri was talking about the Manager again.</p>
<p>They had become friends one day when the boy had been the only one who helped Shashadri up when he had tripped and fallen, fracturing his hip. The hip was still painful, but was well on the mend, if you could believe the jail doctors word. The boy thought otherwise.</p>
<p>As the boy had no other friends in jail, he spent most of his free time with Shashadri. During the day, though, he was busy, made to work around the jail cleaning, cutting, sweeping, anything to rehabilitate his brain for reentry into society. The boy didn’t care, he was done with life outside, he secretly dreaded the day he would be sent back to the criminals outside the iron gate.</p>
<h2>Uncle and other criminals</h2>
<p>The boy was named Deepak by his parents. Maybe it was a hope that he would shed light on their lives in the future. They died before he had a chance.</p>
<p>He was brought up, in rural mumbai, by his uncle in return for doing all the menial tasks around the house. Sickly and malnourished, he somehow survived.</p>
<p>He lived his life by stealing and begging. He was 7 when he realized that the <em>“accidents”</em> his friends (<em>colleagues?</em>) had were man-made. Beggars with amputated legs and arms collected more than the full-bodied. Economics is hard to understand at 7, but it was clear to him that risking it all to run away would cost him less than an arm and/or a leg.</p>
<p>He got into a metro train compartment just as it was leaving to elude his “handler”. Once he reached the terminus, he switched onto an inter-state and left Mumbai behind.</p>
<p>He got down in Vasco-da-gama, Goa.</p>
<h2>Shashadri gets worse</h2>
<p>Shashadri wasn’t doing well. The boy had told him that it was smelling bad. It had become green a bit. The doctor gave him some medicine and sent him back to the Cell. Shashadri couldn’t walk now and spent his days lying in his bunk bed.</p>
<p>They had evacuated his bunk mate because of the smell. In-fact the boy was his only visitor. Even the orderlies used to hand the food to him to give to Shashadri, covering their mouths with their towels when they came near the cell.</p>
<p>Its wasn’t death yet, the boy knew, he knew how death smelt. The smell reminded him of the slum where he used to live with his uncle. It could kill you if you didn’t have some reason to live. He used to have a reason to live, thats why he survived, but it wasn’t there any more. Or if it was there, he couldn’t sense it.</p>
<blockquote><em><b>When the going is good, you don’t need a reason to live. Its only when dying starts to feel the easier option, that your reason for living becomes important.</b></em></blockquote>
<h2>Goa, the ocean and Madame Murray</h2>
<p>Vasco-da-gama railway station. Tired and hungry, he grabbed a bun from the bread stand and ran. It was a wasted effort, no-one saw him. The bun lasted him the day.</p>
<p>One of the happiest moments of his life, was seeing the Sea. Such a large continuous area bereft of the cancer of the human race. It was purifying in a way, just being near it. It was just before sunset, the sky was in various shades of orange. His feet were sore from all the walking so he dipped them into the cool waters of the Indian Ocean. He, ofcourse, didn’t know of oceans at the time. After a bit, he sat down on the beach, eating the last remains of the bun he had stolen in the morning, not once did his eyes leave the ocean.</p>
<p>He would later learn the beach’s name — Bogmalo. Having nowhere else to go he decided to sleep on the beach. He fell asleep immediately, ignorant of the fact that its illegal to sleep on beaches in Goa.</p>
<p>He was awakened by a rude jolt of pain shooting from the sole of his left foot. A policeman stood over him gesturing menacingly with his bamboo stick. It was dark all around. The boy could just about make out the features of the policeman in the pale moonlight. His first instinct was to run. Judging by the pot-belly of the policeman, escape was certain. He didn’t though. Years later he still couldn’t put his finger on why, but on an impulse he told the policeman the truth.</p>
<p>About 200 meters from the beach on a slight incline is the church of mother Teresa. It runs an orphanage and the policeman dropped the boy off there. It was run by a young nun in her mid-30’s, her name to all the congregation and children in the orphanage was Madame Murray.</p>
<p>Years of dealing with truant children had made Madame Murray a very strict lady. Her grey eyes could make you feel a plethora of emotions from joy to repentance with a single glance, but there was always a hint of hope in her eyes. A hope that made the most punished and guilty children feel, that they too could be saved, that they too could grow up to become good little Christians with a little help. Deepak distrusted her from the first day he met her. His uncle had been nice in the beginning.</p>
<h2>Shashadri takes tuition</h2>
<p><em>“Education is the best way to protect yourself”</em> said Shashadri as he rested his back against the wall. This was one of his better days. Deepak nodded as he had learnt to nod whenever he heard that particular tone of voice. The words were still gibberish, but he knew that he could elicit approval by nodding at just the right moment with the right frequency.</p>
