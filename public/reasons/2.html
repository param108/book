<h1>Chapter 2: Shashadri takes Tuition</h1>
<p><em>“Deepak, I want to give you something“</em> said Shashadri. He noticed the confusion on the boys face. He tried to gesture. First he placed both his hands on his sternum and then extended his hands towards the boy.</em>
<p>Deepak understood. He raised his hands showing his palms to the older convict. He didn’t want anything. <b>That was so true as to be scary.</b></p>
<p>Shashadri pointed to a white bag under his bed. Deepak walked over and pulled it out to look inside. They were books. On the top were books Deepak had read before, A — B — C — D…. The ones below had numbers and further down seemed more complicated.</p>
<p><em>“I don’t think I have much time to live”</em> said Shashadri pointing to his swelling hip. <em>“I want to do one thing right in my life”.</em></p>
<p>Shashadri could see that the boy didn’t understand. Maybe this is an impossible idea, he thought to himself hanging his head in resignation. A few moments later he looked up to see the boy coming towards him holding the alphabet book.</p>
<p>The boy sat to Shashadri’s left, away from the wounded hip. He placed the book on the ground and opened it to the first page.</p>
<p>Deepak pointed to the Capital A on the top left of the page and said “A”. He then pointed to the apple and looked at Shashadri questioningly.</p>
<p><b><em>“Apple”</b></em> replied the old man with relief writ large on his face.</p>
<h2>Out of the frying pan into the fire</h2>
<p>Deepak was given a mattress on the floor in the corner of the dormitory. There were no bunks here, just a large room with windows on both sides with mattresses laid continuously along both walls. There were 25 boys there. The boys on the other mattresses looked at him suspiciously as he was brought in carrying his donated bedsheet and clothes. Only the underwear he carried was brand new, donated by monthly offerings of the congregation who shuddered at the thought of someone wearing second hand underwear.</p>
<p>Even after Madame Murray left and turned off the light, he didn’t go to sleep immediately. He sat in the dark watching. He fell asleep without his knowing, cross-legged, hunched over his pile of clothes. Later he laid down still hugging his clothes and the bedsheet, he was too tired to care about an attack, but by god they would not get his belongings.</p>
<p>The sound of the morning birds woke him. He blinked open and quickly sat up. His uncle would whip children who slept late with his metal tipped belt. The pain was excruciating but the wounds were the dangerous part. If they didn’t heal, they were taken to the “doctor”. Boys who went to the “doctor” seldom came out alive or in one piece.</p>
<p>It wasn’t light outside yet, but the lights in the corridor were turned on and he could see ladies wearing flowing grey gowns (nuns clothes he would later learn) moving here and there outside.</p>
<p>A man wearing a brown gown appeared at the entrance of the room.</p>
<p>He turned on the lights in the room and shouted at the top of his voice <b><em>“UP everyone, gods work is waiting”</em></b>. Then he started clapping his hands.
<p>The boys got up one by one, made their beds and single file left the room. No one paid any attention to Deepak. Deepak decided to fall in behind them. As he was walking out, he suddenly felt a hand on his shoulder. His first instinct again was to run and he tried, but the hand held fast.</p>
<p>He turned to see the man in the gown.</p>
<p><em>“What is your name?”</em> said the man. Deepak knew this much english. Even his uncle had been able to teach him that.</p>
<p><em>“Deepak”</em> he said.</p>
<p><em>“Welcome Deepak, I am Father Donald.”</em> said the man gesturing to himself. <em>“If you need anything, just talk to me.”</em></p>
<p>Not seeing any reaction on the boys face, Father Donald kneeled down. <em>“Dont be afraid my son”</em> he continued <em>“Jesus has saved you”</em> and gave the boy a tight hug.</p>
<p>Deepak struggled wildly against the embrace, and feeling his discomfort the father let him go. Deepak panicked and ran, when he was at a safe distance he looked back at the man who had caught him, the man stared back at him, all he could see was malice. Deepak pushed past the other boys and entered the first toilet which was open. He locked the door from inside and squatted into a corner, he could feel his heart beating in his ears. He was trapped. The other boys started banging on the door, Deepak squatted lower in the corner.</p>
<p>After a while the banging stopped and 2 gruff male voices could be heard outside. The lock inside was a simple hook lock.</p>

<p>Deepak saw a thin scale slide through the thin gap between the door and the wall. Deepak stood up, his heartbeat climbing higher and higher, he picked up the metal bucket, readying himself for the attack. The scale moved upward and the lock sprung open, the door opened with a bang and 2 hefty guards with sticks barged through. Deepak had the bucket handle in his right hand. He swung and hit the first guard square on the side of the head. The guard having nowhere else to go in the cramped toilet collapsed, unconscious on top of Deepak.</p>
<p>Deepak flailed his hands Wildly scratching at the fallen mans back, but the man was unconscious and couldn’t move. Then Deepak was sobbing uncontrollably. The tears flowed hot and furious. He remembered his dismembered friends, his uncle’s cruel punishments, his escape. He thought he had escaped all that, but there was no escape , <b><em>it was all the same.</em></b></p>
